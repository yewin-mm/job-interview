* So, if you want to add new currency, just add your currency and value in `application.properties`.
* I just load data one time when the application was started.
* Please note that there were a lot of difference not only changing currencies, but also changing positions <br> 
and sometimes, two currencies are there and some are unstructured format. Even some have character encoding issue.
* I control all the things as much as I can and convert it to BAHT currency which is use as default currency in this application.

#### Testing
* Import `job-interview.postman_collection.json` file under project directory (see that file in project directory) into your installed Postman application.
    * Click in your Postman (top left corner) import -> file -> upload files -> {choose that json file} and open/import.
    * After that, you can see the folder which you import from file in your Postman.
* There are total of 13 APIs in there, and you can test all APIs. 

***After that you can see the code***
